### Project Plan for "Pixel Oracle" Website

---

#### **Project Overview**  
The "Pixel Oracle" website is a simple, user-friendly platform with a pixelated aesthetic. It will feature three clickable links to web apps: "Tarot Cart Reader," "Love Chemistry Calculator," and "Magic Advice Oracle." The design will be clean and visually consistent with the pixelated theme.

#### **Main Tasks**  

1. **Project Setup**  
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.  
   - Set up a basic project structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files).  
   - Choose a development environment (e.g., VS Code).  

2. **Design and Layout**  
   - Select a pixelated font (e.g., "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts).  
   - Set the background color to grey (`#808080` or similar).  
   - Create a simple, centered layout for the title and links.  
   - Ensure the design is responsive for mobile and desktop views.  

3. **Content Creation**  
   - Add the title "Pixel Oracle" using the chosen pixelated font.  
   - Create three clickable links for the web apps:  
     - "Tarot Cart Reader"  
     - "Love Chemistry Calculator"  
     - "Magic Advice Oracle"  
   - Style the links to be prominent and easy to click (e.g., buttons with hover effects).  

4. **Testing and Debugging**  
   - Test the website on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).  
   - Check responsiveness on different screen sizes.  
   - Debug any issues with layout, fonts, or links.  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Host the website on a platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).  
   - Verify the live site is accessible and functional.

#### **Technical Considerations**  

- **HTML:**  
  - Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<a>`).  
  - Ensure proper meta tags for responsiveness (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`).  

- **CSS:**  
  - Use a CSS reset or normalize.css to ensure consistent styling across browsers.  
  - Apply the pixelated font and grey background.  
  - Style links as buttons with padding, borders, and hover effects.  

- **JavaScript:**  
  - Minimal JavaScript required unless additional interactivity is needed.  

- **Responsiveness:**  
  - Use media queries to adjust layout for smaller screens.  
  - Ensure fonts and buttons scale appropriately.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Use descriptive link text for screen readers.  
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.

#### **Timeline**  

1. **Day 1:** Project setup, design, and layout.  
2. **Day 2:** Content creation and initial styling.  
3. **Day 3:** Testing, debugging, and final adjustments.  
4. **Day 4:** Deployment and final review.

#### **Deliverables**  
- A fully functional "Pixel Oracle" website hosted on a live platform.  
- Clean, pixelated design with three prominent web app links.  
- Documentation (if required) for future updates or maintenance.
